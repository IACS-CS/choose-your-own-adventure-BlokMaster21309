<button onclick="handleUserInteraction()">Enable Music</button>
<script>//taken direclty from somewhere and then edited cuz it didnt work but idk where its from (PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU BLOCKED REDDIT!!)

// In your JavaScript file
function handleUserInteraction() {
  const audio = document.getElementById('my-audio');
  audio.play().then(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('autoplay-preference', 'true');
  }).catch(error => {
    console.error('Autoplay failed:', error);
  });
}

// On page load, check for the user's preference
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const autoplayAllowed = localStorage.getItem('autoplay-preference');
  if (autoplayAllowed === 'true') {
    // This will attempt to autoplay, but may still be blocked by the browser.
    // It's still better to get a user interaction on each page.
    // For a seamless experience, an SPA is the only reliable solution.
    const audio = document.getElementById('my-audio');
    audio.muted = true; // Autoplaying muted audio is often allowed
    audio.play();
  }
});</script>
